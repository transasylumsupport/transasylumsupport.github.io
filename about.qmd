The Trans Asylum Seeker Support Network (TASSN) is a border abolitionist, direct action, and mutual aid collective supporting trans and queer people seeking asylum.

We provide comprehensive support to asylum seekers throughout their asylum processes and beyond, including community connection, housing assistance, healthcare access, legal support, monthly stipends, life skills training, education, and employment resources.

TASSN operates through a solidarity-not-charity framework. Our collective includes both trans and queer asylum seekers and volunteer organizers working together toward the abolition of all cages and borders, joyful militancy, decolonization, land back, and trans liberation.
