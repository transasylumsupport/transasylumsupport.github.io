## Who We Are

The Trans Asylum Seeker Support Network (TASSN) is an anarchist, border abolitionist mutual aid collective supporting trans and queer people seeking asylum from the Caribbean, Latin America, and Palestine. Our network spans seven states: Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Philadelphia, Texas, and Washington.

We operate through a solidarity-not-charity framework, bringing together both asylum seekers and volunteer organizers in the struggle for trans liberation, decolonization, land back, and the abolition of all cages and borders.

## How We Work

As a structured decolonial collective, we use consensus decision-making to develop comprehensive support strategies. We typically support asylum seekers for around seven yearsâ€”from initial contact through case resolution and community integration.

Our grassroots structure means no paid staff and 100% direct distribution of funds to asylum seekers. Only minimal operational costs (Zoom, outreach materials) are deducted from donations.

## What We Provide

We offer holistic, trauma-informed support addressing every aspect of asylum seekers' lives: monthly stipends, housing assistance, legal representation, gender-affirming healthcare access, transportation, remittance support, community connection, life skills training, education resources, and employment assistance.

While we historically focused on detention exit, we now provide comprehensive legal, emotional, medical, linguistic, and financial support throughout the entire asylum process.

## Our Vision & Values

We work toward abolishing the root causes of migration through decolonial, anti-imperialist, and Indigenous liberation movements while building transformative relationships with trusted comrades.

Our organizing is grounded in nonhierarchical leadership, trust, autonomy, radical kindness, and grassroots mutual aid. We advance class abolition, reparations, anti-capitalism, border abolition, migrant justice, transliberation, and Black and Indigenous liberation.

## Support Our Work

Monthly donors sustain our commitment to each asylum seeker. Recurring donations help us plan consistent, long-term support.

One-time donations are always appreciated. For donations over \$500, please use Venmo @transasylumsupport to avoid processing fees and maximize direct aid.
